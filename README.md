Household Builder
=================

Your application needs a way to capture information about a household applying
for health insurance coverage. Develop a UI for building a household up from
individual people.

* Validate data entry (age is required and > 0, relationship is required)
* Add people to a growing household list
* Remove a previously added person from the list
* Display the household list in the HTML as it is modified
* Serialize the household as JSON upon form submission as a fake trip to the server (into "debug" DOM element)
